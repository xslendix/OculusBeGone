# OculusBeGone!

This program completly kills the Oculus Dash and launches SteamVR. This is based on [Kaitlyn's discovery](https://github.com/ItsKaitlyn03/OculusKiller).

Oculus's dash is known to use a considerable amount of resources, replacing the dash with this will free up a lot of resources so you can play other SteamVR titles.

Please note that you will no longer be able to play games on your oculus library!

To install, simply download this repository, extract it somewhere and run the "install.ps1" script as admin. After installation is complete, you can delete the repository.

You can launch an admin powershell instance in the current directory by going to File -> "Open Windows Powershell" -> "Open Windows Powershell as Administrator". Then execute ".\install.ps1".
